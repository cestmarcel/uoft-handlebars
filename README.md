## Usage

The user can add menu items (for the purposes of this app: burgers) to the application by entering them in the textfield and clicking "submit." The user will then find the menu items to be devoured in the left column above the textfield. A menu item can be devoured by clicking the "Devour!" button next to the item. Once devoured, the menu item will be displayed in the right column of the screen and is crossed out to indicate that this menu item is no longer available.

The added menu items are persistent across different sessions.

Here's an example for what new and devoured menu items look like:
